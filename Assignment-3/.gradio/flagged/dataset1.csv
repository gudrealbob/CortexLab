what is DDD,"Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes creating a rich domain model based on input from domain experts. It focuses on using a ubiquitous language that is consistently used by developers and domain experts in all communication. The software design in DDD is driven by the domain model rather than technical concerns, and it aims to manage complexity by isolating the domain layer from infrastructure and user interface concerns. DDD utilizes various patterns such as entities, value objects, services, aggregates, repositories, and factories to build a domain model that accurately reflects the business domain.",2025-08-31 23:06:13.438274
